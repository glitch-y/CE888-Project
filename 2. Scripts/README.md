This README describes the structure associated with the scripts for processing the TweetEval data sets for 'emotion', 'hate' and 'offensive'.

=== Code Structure ===
  1. Preprocessing scripts
  - Preprocessing_Emotion
  - Preprocessing_Hate
  - Preprocessing_Offensive
  2. Modelling scripts (Will form part of 'Assignment 2'
  - Modelling_Emotion
  - Modelling_Hate
  - Modelling_Offensive

=== Code Desciptions ===
  1. The preprocessing codes follow an identical approach as per below:
  - data import
  - replacement of misspelled words
  - replacement of internet slang abbreviations
  - removal of HTML elements
  - removal of language contractions
  - conversion of emojis into text
  - removal of punctuation
  - removal of user mentions
  - mapping of tweets as per the TweetEval guidance
  - exploration of mapped data
  - the outputs from each of the 3 preprocessing scripts are located in folder 3. Datasets of this repository
  2. The modelling codes will follow an almost identical approach for all 3 data sets
     and will form part of 'Assignment 2'
